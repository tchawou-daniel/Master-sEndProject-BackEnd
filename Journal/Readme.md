 # Project Advancement

## - Monday, January 10th 2022 -
### First 4h hours

```
We explored project ideas. We have not yet selected among those we have in mind, because it 
is also necessary to evaluate the time needed to achieve the minimum functional (version 0). 
The choice is not yet clear, but we already know that we are going to create a web platform.

The second priority was which partner we would implement the project with among our comrades
and two of the criteria were the technologies and the project. So we met some comrades and 
discuss their subject and the technologies they are going to use.
```
### Second 4h hours
```
We thought about the technologies (languages, frameworks,...) we will use for the project,
concerning precisely
- the front-end, 
- back-end (create API or not), 
- tools for tests, 
- DevOps tools, 
- database(MySQL or Postgres), 
- UX design 
and so on. The time that we must devote to technologies that are not fully mastered or which 
are new. We looked at the platforms and courses we have to use in order to learn fastly or 
to enhance our knowledge on some important technologies for our projects. At the end of this 
reflection, some tools and technologies were selected. A document was produced in order to 
explain our choices about the technologies and tools.

One of our main concerns was also how we would manage time and tasks and what tools we would 
use for that. 
```
[The document ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yIE2LbqWsI8fIg_zS-Ywr3HgrX2ibk2yNp6sQqmCxp8/edit?usp=sharing) produced today on the technologies we will use
## - Tuesday, January 11th 2022 -
### First 3h hours
```
In this working session:
- we have chosen a subject for our project
- we thought again about the technologies we should use, notably the advantages and disadvantages, 
the ease of implementation, and for others the ease of learning 
```
### Second 5h hours
```
In this working session:
- we have planned the time to complete the project (minimum functional)
- It was also important for us to select the trainings that we should follow to carry out the project.
- Another point concerned the definition of use cases. We have started to define them and to choose the ones 
that have priority for the v0 version.
- At the end of this session, we had a problem with our working pc, so we lost more than 45min
```

### First 3h hours

```
The content of this working session :
- We followed a cypress training before this session, in the morning on unit tests through a youtube video. Here is the link of the training https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVNjsIto9xM&t=461s. Here is the link of my repository concerning this training(...)
- We have browsed the documentation on Circleci, docker, Netlify, Heroku
- We also installed the environment of work and configure webstorm
```
### Second 4h hours
```
- We have browsed the documentation on Auth0
- we have started to prepare the working environment for the front-end(Cypress, Storybook, reactjs, Typescript, dependencies...)
```

## - Monday, February 21th 2022 -

### First 3h hours

```
The content of this working session :
- we started to make the schema of the database
```
### Second 4h hours
```
- We configured the circleci in the front and back project
- We have tried to resolve the issue with storybook
```

## - Tuesday, February 22th 2022 -
### For 40 minutes outside the school schedule
```
- small training on youtube concerning the storybook: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLwX9EWlWJM&ab_channel=Grafikart.fr
```
### First 3h hours
```
- We have worked on the conception of the database
- We resolved the issue concerning the storybook
```
### Second 4h hours
```
- We started to set up the back-end environment 
- We resolved some circleci issues concerning the front-end of our apps
- We have tried unsuccessfully to solve this problem Circleci : Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/circleci/project/src/react-app-env.d.ts'

```
## - Wednesday, February 23th 2022 -
```
- We resolved the issues concerning the back-end side and we have continued to configure the environment
- We have continued the training about the nestjs on Udemy (...)
```

## - Saturday, February 26th 2022 -
```
- We continued and finished the training about the nestjs on Udemy (...)
```

## - Monday, February 28th 2022 -
### First 3h hours

```
We encoutered some problems  regarding the circleci of the front-end part such as:
- warning ../../package.json: No license field
- Error: Cannot find module '/home/.../config/webpack.config.dev'
- react-dom.development.js:24828 Uncaught Error: Target container is not a DOM element.

```
### Second 4h hours
```
- We advanced with the database schema and architecture
- We resolved the issues with the front-end side
- We fixed the errors of the circleci on the back-end side
```
## - Tuesday, March 1st 2022 -
### First 3h hours
```
we worked on the database schema:
- We have tried to see the best approach for our application architecture. How we are going to index the companies for example and the sub-branches of those companies.
- We have evaluated if we have to use mysql or postgresql.
- We evaluated if we should start for the v0 application with a multi-tenant architecture or not, because in the long run we want to use a multi-tenant architecture. This is the best architecture for our project.

we looked at the documentation and some videos about auth0 to see if we will finally use this authentication method or not.

```
### Second 4h hours
```
- We connected the back-end to our database
- We started to implement the authentification. It's already possible to sign in and sign up an user. 
- We have created the security around the authentication. 
```

## - Monday, March 14st 2022 -
### First 7h hours
```
- we have configured the environment, access to the database on mysql
- We tried to implement the authentication part with auth0 and we wasted a lot of time on it without success in the end
```

## - Tuesday, March 15st 2022 -
### First 2h hours
```
- We finally found how to implement auth0 with nest but we choose to use Jwt Authentication for earn in time. 
   And perhaps we will change our way to authenticate later in order to use Auth0.
```

### Second 5h hours
```
- We advanced with the database schema and architecture
- We started to visualise on miro how the application will be in terms of interface
- We change our database (mysql to postgres) because it's cheaper to deploy a database on postgres on heroku 
than to deploy a mysql database.
- we compared the prices and advantages of the free and paid plan in terms of the connection limit number, the storage capacity, the row limit number
```
