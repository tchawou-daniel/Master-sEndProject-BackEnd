 # Project Advancement

## - Monday, January 10th 2022 -
### First 4h hours

```
We explored project ideas. We have not yet selected among those we have in mind, because it 
is also necessary to evaluate the time needed to achieve the minimum functional (version 0). 
The choice is not yet clear, but we already know that we are going to create a web platform.

The second priority was which partner we would implement the project with among our comrades
and two of the criteria were the technologies and the project. So we met some comrades and 
discuss their subject and the technologies they are going to use.
```
### Second 4h hours
```
We thought about the technologies (languages, frameworks,...) we will use for the project,
concerning precisely
- the front-end, 
- back-end (create API or not), 
- tools for tests, 
- DevOps tools, 
- database(MySQL or Postgres), 
- UX design 
and so on. The time that we must devote to technologies that are not fully mastered or which 
are new. We looked at the platforms and courses we have to use in order to learn fastly or 
to enhance our knowledge on some important technologies for our projects. At the end of this 
reflection, some tools and technologies were selected. A document was produced in order to 
explain our choices about the technologies and tools.

One of our main concerns was also how we would manage time and tasks and what tools we would 
use for that.
